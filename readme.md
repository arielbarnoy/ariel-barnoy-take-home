# Setup
Check if node is installed by running ``node -v``.
If not installed, install it by running ``npm install -g npm`` (Note: this assumes that you have npm installed)

Check if Typescript is installed by running ``tsc -v``.
If not installed, run ``npm install typescript --save-dev``.

# Running
In the `ariel-barnoy-take-home` folder, run `npm start` or `npx ts-node src/index.ts input.json`.

# Output
The output file will generate in the ``output`` folder as `output.json`.

There will already be an existing output file for you to look over.
